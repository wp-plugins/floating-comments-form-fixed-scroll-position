Floating Comments allows users to post comments to your blog through a fancy form that fallows them as they scroll down.

== Description ==

This lightweight plugin creates a form that is placed by default at the left of the 
content, and is fixed to the top of the page once it gets to it.

Floatin Comments serves as an alternative form to post comments that is very handy 
compared to the traditional comments form. Given that it follows you as you scroll down by 
the page, you can post a comment being at the bottom of the page but also at the 
top.
